# Resolver API

When integrating WebSockets with larger projects, it is often needed to dynamically route an incoming event to websocket hooks. crossws provides a very simple mechanism to do this using resolver API.

> [!TIP]
> Resolver supports async results. This allows implementing lazy loading.

```js
// https://crossws.h3.dev/adapters
import crossws from "crossws/adapters/<adapter>";

import { defineHooks } from "crossws";

const websocket = crossws({
  async resolve(req) {
    // TODO: Resolve hooks based on req.url, req.headers
    // You can return undefined in case there is no match
    return {
      /* resolved hooks */
    };
  },
});
```

If you need to change resolve function (for cases like handling HMR):

```ts
let resolveWebSocketHooks = (req) => /* ... */

const websocket = crossws({
  async resolve(req) {
    return resolveWebSocketHooks(req)
  },
});

// Update reference to `resolveWebSocketHooks` later.
```
